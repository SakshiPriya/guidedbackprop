This is a implementation of guided backpropagation introduced in paper Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net(arXiv:1412.6806).
The idea of saliency map(class saliency extraction) is also used which was originally introduced in paper, Deep Inside Convolutional Networks:
Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps(arXiv:1312.6034)
